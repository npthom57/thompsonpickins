# Welcome to MARCH MADNESS

## Rules

All right, all right, all right hoopsnosticators, it is time to put your hardwood expertise to the test in the 2022 Thompson Family Pickins'. COVID has added an extra challenge this year by introducing seemingly random game cancelations that you cagey cager experts are going to have to factor into your roundball predictions, but at least you won't have to wear a mask while doing it.


Rules:\
1st Round ... 2 pts  \
2nd Round ... 4  \
Sweet 16 .... 6  \
Elite 8 ..... 8  \
Final Four .. 10  \
Title Game .. 12  


You may pick an upset special for each region through the first 2 rounds worth the difference in the seeds. We will pick one upset special total for the Sweet 16, Elite 8 and Final 4.

Remember, you do not have to pick an upset special and there is a regional bonus each round for the first two rounds. If you pick any region completely correct in the first round you will earn 5 bonus points. If you pick any 2 regions completely correct in the second round you will receive 4 bonus points.

***COVID 19 PROTOCOL***. It wouldn't be 2020-2021 without C-19 accommodations. If a game is canceled, we just don't count it. If it was your upset special, tough luck on that half-court shot, it rimmed out. If the whole tourney is canceled, I win.

Names: Come up with a competition stage name. Send it to me. I'll list them and we'll vote. Send them by group me or text....that way I won't miss them and will get them quicker.

Finally, we will start a new tradition this year. No bones in the pot....Instead, we will borrow from Miami's "Turnover Chain" ( like everyone else has) and I will make some trophy bling for us to pass around from year to year to see how long we can keep up with it. We started this with our Super Bowl Party in Austin this past year and it was quite cute, with Emma and Teo trading it off... ðŸ™„ They are not allowed in the pool....Granddad rule.

McWiz will send out a link when he has the Pickins' Tabulatory Machine ready. Good luck all, and GO HEELS!


# Scoreboard

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uq1NGx2SQdCxeS8CiY3pGke5H1PTH7bigNAjjMFh3Kk/edit?usp=sharing) for live scores.

I will put an end of round scoreboard here, if the round is over and there is no scoreboard here please let me know.

# What If Simulator

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Agmoek91nLDOqPd5EFf9fsR7GYrhrPDephO7ESxbNc/edit?usp=sharing) to go to the what if simulator where you see what the round's score would be if certain teams won.

I'm trying to see if I can make an even easier to use tool where you just click buttons but I am new to most of this so that might have to wait until next year. For now you can just input winners into this google doc to see how it affects the scoreboard.
